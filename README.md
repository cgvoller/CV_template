# CV Template
> A template CV made in overleaf (LaTeX). This is quite a compact CV.
# WIP
>  I have shared this template with friends although as they don't know LaTeX, I end up writing it for them. As such, I will be updating this so that it is more user-friendly to make changes to the colours, sections and contents. I've seen someone use a yaml file so maybe this is the way forward.
